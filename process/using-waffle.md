##Labels and their meaning
###Stages (blue, mostly)
_icebox_ : work that has been suggested, but has not been prioritized or is in some other way not yet actionable
_backlog_ : actionable work that is just waiting for the appropriate dev or designer to begin
_design_ : work that is in the design ideation/testing phase - if your work is in this phase you should be focusing on how your component looks and behaves, and making sure it can fill all of the required use cases
_ready_ : work that has been designed and gained the approval of the foundations council, but either does not exist in code yet, or the code that exists has not received attention wrt its interface/implementation details
_development_ : work that is in the process of being coded and documented
_review_ : coded work that needs to be reviewed in the form of a pull request
_approved_ : work that has been reviewed and approved in the form of a pull request, but has yet to be integrated into master and released
_done_ : work that has been released and is available on the master branch of ferrous

###Types (green, mostly)
_new component_ :  a new component
_component review/improvement_ : a change or extension to an existing component
_discussion_ : a placeholder for a discussion - no actionable work yet
_quick win_ : use this label for work that could probably be accomplished quickly and with minimal extenuating concerns (one person could do it and it will be pretty simple)
_bug_ : s***'s broken

###Other
_respond_ : tag work that has been reviewed in the form of a pull request and found lacking with this label to let the dev working on it know that it needs their attention
