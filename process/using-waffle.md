##Labels and their meaning
###Stages (blue, mostly)
- *icebox* : work that has been suggested, but has not been prioritized or is in some other way not yet actionable
- *backlog* : actionable work that is just waiting for the appropriate dev or designer to begin
- *design* : work that is in the design ideation/testing phase - if your work is in this phase you should be focusing on how your component looks and behaves, and making sure it can fill all of the required use cases
- *ready* : work that has been designed and gained the approval of the foundations council, but either does not exist in code yet, or the code that exists has not received attention wrt its interface/implementation details
- *development* : work that is in the process of being coded and documented
- *review* : coded work that needs to be reviewed in the form of a pull request
- *approved* : work that has been reviewed and approved in the form of a pull request, but has yet to be integrated into master and released
- *done* : work that has been released and is available on the master branch of ferrous

###Types (green, mostly)
- *new component* :  a new component
- *component review/improvement* : a change or extension to an existing component
- *discussion* : a placeholder for a discussion - no actionable work yet
- *quick win* : use this label for work that could probably be accomplished quickly and with minimal extenuating concerns (one person could do it and it will be pretty simple)
- *bug* : s***'s broken

###Other
- *respond* : tag work that has been reviewed in the form of a pull request and found lacking with this label to let the dev working on it know that it needs their attention
